## HI ðŸ‘‹, I'm Joon Yeol, Lee: developing game!

I love games and development!

The reason I like games is that through games, I can implement logics(algorithms) and express my thoughts in the products.

The reason I like development is that I enjoy the process of communicating with other team members and creating a final product within a project that progresses in units.
