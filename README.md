## HI ðŸ‘‹, I'm Joon Yeol, Lee: developing game!

I love games and development!

The reason I like games is that through making games, I can implement logics(algorithms) and express my thoughts in the products. Vice Versa, I can get to know others' as well!

The reason I like development is that I enjoy the process of communicating with team members and creating a final product within a project that progresses in unit.

## Currently working on...
*42Seoul Open Project(Developer Friendly Game Platform): Small-sized Game Developer*

*Metaverse Dev Contest: Unity Dev & Game Script Writing*
